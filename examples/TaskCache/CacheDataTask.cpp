/*
* Task Ending example for Arduino Tasker
* 
* This file implements all declared functions from CacheDataTask.h
* 
* This task needs to calculate some valuse and send them to some external device
* The process of calculation takes time, sometimes calculations 
* and simultaneous data sending may affect devices communication.
* 
* To avoid that you may use cache() method.
* Cache is called before update, so you can do your calculations there,
* and send data in next step.
